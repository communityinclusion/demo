<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>    
<p>Sometimes the best way to learn is to simply connect with other people who do what you do. Asking a question, posting an idea, or sharing a resource Person to person. To facilitate this connection, Think College has set up online communication – where you can easily reach out to others about a particular topic or area of interest. These online groups are hosted on a real-time chat platform called <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a>.</p>  

<p>Slack works like an instant messaging board with “channels” on the left-hand side that categorize conversation by topic. Everything is easily searchable and the tool supports direct messaging to any member of the group. These online discussion groups are a safe place for like-minded (or like-employed) individuals to connect.</p> 

<p>This format allows us to create any number of discussion groups or “channels” to support sharing among the members of our community. Channels can be public or open to all, other may be specifically for certain members such as TPSIDs.</p> 

<p>For example, staff from a program interested in becoming a Comprehensive Transition Program can join the “CTP channel” to get support and guidance from others interested in that specific topic. That person will also benefit from being a member of the “general” channel, where all users will come together to chat on broad topics related to inclusive higher education.  New channels can be added to support discussion and sharing on new topics of interest to the group.</p>

<p>Every online discussion group will be moderated and facilitated by Think College staff, who will check in regularly, respond to questions, and encourage cross talk among each groups’ members.</p>

    Cindy Johnson, at ABC University, is beginning the process of establishing on-campus housing for students in their program. She has questions that her
    colleagues in the field may be able to help with. She logs onto Slack </a> and…

<div class="well">
<p>
    <strong>Cindy Johnson:</strong> I am just starting to work on the relationships I will need to set up campus housing for the students in my program. Should I start with the
    Residence Life Office or the Disability Services office?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bob Duffy:</strong> At my university, we…. I know <strong>@Scott Smith</strong> has done things differently though.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Scott Smith:</strong> Hey, <strong>@Bob</strong>. <strong>@Cindy</strong>, I’m happy to help. Here’s the document [upload/pin] we sent to both Residence Life and DS.

    <h2 id="groups">Current Discussion Groups</h2>

<p><strong>General</strong> (moderated by Rebecca Lazo): This is a more casual forum; the purpose of this channel is to share general announcements, ask questions not applicable to existing channels, and just chat.  New channels can be requested here as well.</p>

<p><strong>TPSID</strong> chat (moderated by Molly Boyle): This channel is private, only accessible by TPSID program staff; otherwise, there are no specific parameters on topics.</p> 

<p><strong>CTP Application</strong> (moderated by Clare Papay): The purpose of this group is to discuss and share information about the comprehensive transition program application process.</p> 

<p><strong>Campus Housing</strong> (moderated by Carole Carlson): The purpose of this group is to discuss campus housing issues and share resources related to the development and operation of inclusive campus residential options.</p>
